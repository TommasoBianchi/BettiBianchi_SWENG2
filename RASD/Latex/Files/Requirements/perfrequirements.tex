A system such as \projectname~ may achieve exponential growth of users in a short time after appropriate marketing policies. For this reason, the system must be able to manage a large number of simultaneous requests and therefore have high-performance and easily expandable infrastructures. The systems used for saving data must be efficient, because with the growth of users, the increase in the number of data between meetings, user profiles and transport means would be considerable.\\
It is expected that the number of users will grow up to 500000 in a short time because the system is an innovative service that could significantly simplify workers' lives. The main target are big cities with a high number of people and companies. The system functionality that offers the possibility to add contacts and create groups could facilitate \projectname's expansion.
