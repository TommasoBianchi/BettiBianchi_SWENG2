\subsubsection{Meetings}
A meeting is an event organized by a user with a title, a date and a location. The user who creates the event becomes the first administrator of the meeting and consequently can access all the functionalities described in the next sections. Those who are invited to a meeting can accept, decline or reschedule the invitation. The rescheduling request consists in asking the administrators if it is possible to change the date of the meeting; this proposal might have been generated because this meeting is inconsistent w.r.t. user's schedule and signaled by a warning of the system at the moment of invitation. \\
A meeting has a chat that can be used for organizational purposes and users' interaction. It is possible to upload files and add personal or public notes.\\
Meetings are divided in categories and subcategories to organize them. There is a special type of meeting called \textit{Instant Meeting} that is a meeting with only one participant and that does not last in time. Instant meetings are exactly like normal ones except for the fact that they are instantaneous (such as bring children at school). Even if they do not have a duration, it is essential to take them into account to organize schedule and travels during the day.

\subsubsection{Travels}

The system manages the user's travels through scheduled appointments during the day. The system will a priori calculate the duration of the trip from the default location to the appointment's one; from 15 minutes beforehand, it will begin to make use of the user's position to provide precise, real-time indications regarding the departure time and the path to follow. The available travel means are walking, driving (owned or shared), biking (owned or shared) and public transportation. The use of each of them may be restricted or completely inhibited by the user through customizable constraints. The system will propose to the user the best indications according to these constraints and its preference list. The system will then recommend and give real time indications to the user about the first path in the weighted preference list, according to constraints imposed. While computing the best path, system will take into account all of user's meetings during the day and will choose the more suitable travel mean.
