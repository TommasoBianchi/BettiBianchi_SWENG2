The system will be implemented trying to combine together services already on the market as presented in the document's scope. Since there are no services like \projectname~, our system will be developed completely from scratch with the exception of geolocation and mapping services. For these services, external providers can meet the needs of the system. This will guarantee that these services are precise and reliable and will give system managers the opportunity to focus on developing innovative functionality for the \projectname~project.
