\subsubsection{Description of the project}

\projectname~ is a calendar-based service that helps users in managing the scheduling of their meetings, whether for work or personal reasons.
The goal of this project is to create a system that:
\begin{itemize}
\item automatically computes and accounts for travel time between meetings to make sure that the user is never late
\item supports the user in his/her travels, for example by identifying the best mobility option (e.g., use the train from A to B and then the metro to C) while taking into account his preferences (e.g., do not make me walk for more than 15 minutes)
\end{itemize}
Users can create meetings, and when meetings are created at locations that are unreachable in the allotted time, a warning is created. \projectname~ should support a multitude of travel means, including walking, biking (own or shared), public transportation (including taxis), driving (own or shared), etc. A particular user may globally activate or deactivate each travel means. A user should also be able to provide reasonable constraints on different travel means (e.g., walking distances should be less than a given distance, or public transportation should not be used after a given time of day). Additional features could also be envisioned, for instance allowing a user to specify a flexible "lunch". For instance, a user could be able to specify that lunch must be possible every day between 11:30- 14:30, and it must be at least half an hour long, but the specific timing is flexible. The system would then be sure to reserve at least 30 minutes for lunch each day. Similarly, other types of breaks might be scheduled in a customizable way.

Some complementary services, such as planners or maps, already exists on the market; however they do not offer both the possibility to schedule events and to have meaningful information on how to travel between them.
