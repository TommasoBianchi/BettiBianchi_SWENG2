This document is a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD).
The purpose of this document is to completely analyze and describe in a formal and non-ambiguous way the system in terms of its intended domain of use, of the goals it should aim at and of the requirements it should enforce. It also provides reasonable constraints within which the system has to behave in a correct way.
This document is primarily addressed to the development team, who will be in charge of the implementations of the system in its entirety. Other stakeholders, such as investors, may read the first two chapters as they can be the basis of a contractual agreement.
