The work of the algorithm is divided in two main functions: insert\_meeting to insert a new meeting into the user's schedule and best\_travel to compute the best travel between two locations taking into account the user's preference list and constraints. To simplify the execution of the algorithm and to speed it up, inconsistent meetings will be treated as non-existent, so that we can avoid to consider them when calculating travels; this is a fairly strong assumption, but it is needed to avoid all sort of problems tied to overlapping meetings, where it is unclear how to connect them with travels.
