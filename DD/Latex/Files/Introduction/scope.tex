Travlendar+ is a calendar-based service that helps users in managing the scheduling of their meetings, whether for work or personal reasons. The system will be able to automatically compute and account for travel time between meetings to make sure that the user is never late and to support the user in his/her travels by identifying the best mobility option according to his preferences. \\
Users can create meetings, and when meetings are created at locations that are unreachable in the allotted time, a warning is created. Travlendar+ should support a multitude of travel means, including walking, biking, public transportation, driving. A user should be able to provide reasonable constraints on different travel means. Additionally a user will also be able to specify flexible breaks, so that the system would then be sure to reserve enough time for them each day. \\
Some complementary services, such as planners or maps, already exists on the market; however they do not offer both the possibility to schedule events and to have meaningful information on how to travel between them.
