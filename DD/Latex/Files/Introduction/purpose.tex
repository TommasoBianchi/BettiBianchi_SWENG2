This document is a Design Document (DD). The purpose of this document is to describe the architecture of the system for the \projectname project, giving both a high level description of it and a more detailed representation of the various artifacts that will compose it; this will be done primarily by means of various types of UML Diagrams. In the last part of the document it will be also presented an implementation plan, outlining the main steps to be followed in order to build the system. This document is addressed mainly to the development team who will be in charge of the implementation of the system, but it can be a useful reading to anyone interested in understanding how \projectname is working.
