	\textbf{Requirements}            & 		\textbf{Components}		    \\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Each user must provide an email that is not already present in the system & Authentication Engine, User Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Each user must provide a nickname that is not already present in the system & Authentication Engine, User Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Users have to be registered into the system before logging in & Authentication Engine	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Users have to provide an existing email or nickname and the associated password in order to log in; in alternative they can use a supported external login system & Authentication Engine, External Login Adapter	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~A user must be logged into the system to perform any action except registering and logging in & Authentication Engine, Route Manager	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Users cannot have meetings while their status is set to auto-decline & User Controller, Meeting Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~A user cannot have different default locations sharing the start time & User Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Time travel between subsequent default locations should be less than the difference between their start time & User Controller, Travel Planner	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Each meeting that is not an Instant Meeting has at least two participants & Meeting Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Each meeting has at least one administrator & Meeting Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Each meeting has a title, a date and a location & Meeting Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Each participant in a meeting can access shared files and the chat & Meeting Controller, File Uploader, Chat Engine	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Users participate in a meeting if and only if they accept the invitation & Meeting Controller	\\ \hline

	\textbf{R\reqNum}~Users can write in the chat of a meeting if and only if they have received and accepted an invitation to it & Meeting Controller, Chat Engine	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~For each meeting there is a warning iff the meeting is inconsistent & Meeting Scheduler, Notification Engine \\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~The system suggests you a time, according to your settings, to have a break such that no meeting overlaps with it; if no time slot is valid, a warning is generated & Meeting Scheduler, Break Manager	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~At least one travel mean is available in the preference list & User Controller	\\ \hline
	\textbf{R\reqNum}~The travel mean suggested by the system is always the first in the weighted preference list that satisfied all the constraints; if no travel mean satisfied all the constraints than the system suggests the fastest one & Travel Planner, Constraint Engine	\\ \hline
