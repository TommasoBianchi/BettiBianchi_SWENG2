In this section we are going to show some mockups of the system regarding mobile application only. On the RASD document we have presented some web application mockups and how they can be derived from mobile ones; for this reason we suppose UI developers will be able to retrieve correct web application mockups from the followers.\\
During the design of mockups we have followed exactly what is presented on UX diagrams; for obvious reasons we can't show all the screens that are on the UX diagrams, however lot of them has been created trying to clarify precisely how the user should interact with the system.\\
