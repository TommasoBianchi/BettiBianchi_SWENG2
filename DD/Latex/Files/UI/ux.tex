User Interface Design is an important aspect during the developing process of a system. It has the aim to model the part of the system that is related with users, hence it must be simple and efficient, in terms of accomplishing users' goals. Since user's schedule is the crucial point in \projectname~, we thought to use the calendar page as home page of the application in order to facilitate the actions that the user should do more often. Additionally UI of \projectname~ should be concise, responsive, professional and good-looking for the purpose of satisfying all the possible type of users that could interact with the system.\\

In our charts, classes marked with * are the ones that will be analysed more accurately in other diagrams.\\
We are going to present 4 different UX diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Registration/Login}}:
	\item{\textbf{\projectname~}}: UX diagram of the main pages of the system, from the registration/login to all the possible settings. 
	\item{\textbf{Notification}}:
	\item{\textbf{Settings}}:
	\item{\textbf{Meeting Details}}:
\end{itemize}
