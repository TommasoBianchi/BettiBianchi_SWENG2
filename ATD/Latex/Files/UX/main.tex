In this chapter we present our impression on the user experience of the tested project. These are opinions from a user point of view that we have during test and use of the system.

\subsection{Login Page}
In our opinion the login page, made mostly by the strong usage of JavaScript, is good looking even if it does not follow the colour scheme and the general looks of the calendar page found once logged into the system. \\
We found some problem in case of wrong registration: if you insert some wrong data, such as a too short password or a password that is too similar to the username, the system redirects you to the login form but loosing all informations about your inconsistent inserted data.
\subsection{Calendar Main Page}
The calendar page of the system that goes through daily, weekly and monthly views of the calendar, in spite of being similar to Google Calendar page, is really immediate and provide everything you need.
