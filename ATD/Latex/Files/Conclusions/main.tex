We think that the project we tested had a pretty limited scope, still providing all the core functionalities of a Travlendar+ application. Most of the planned goals of the RASD have been accomplished and almost all of the requirements have been satisfied, so we evaluate it positively. \\
The python code is properly structured and well commented, and this makes it fairly readable even without any prior knowledge on the system nor on the framework. The couple of bugs found were not really relevant issues, and we think they can be easily fixed once the development team has been notified of their existence. \\
Overall, the application is easy to use and immediate to understand for any user. Nevertheless, we think that the project needs major improvements and extended functionalities to be properly released on the market.
