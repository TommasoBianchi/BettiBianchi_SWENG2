To install and configure the project we have closely followed the instructions given in Chapter 4 of their ITD. To have a running version of python 3.6, with pip and all needed dependencies, on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial machine, we needed some additional work not reported on the document, so we think that the Prerequisite section of the ITD should have been expanded more. \\
In particular, to install a working version of Django we had to invoke the following console commands: \\

\begin{commandshell}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
cd path/to/Implementation
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
\end{commandshell}
~\\
After that, we had problems in running the Django server from the "I\&T/Implementation" folder, while everything worked perfectly in the folder extracted from the "implementation2017\_01\_07.rar" archive; for the rest of the tests, we kept using the code from the archive. \\
~\\
We also successfully installed the project on a Windows 10 machine using the python3 installer found \href{https://www.python.it/download/}{here}, and then typing 
\begin{commandshell}
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{commandshell}
