To install and configure the project we have closely followed the instructions given in Chapter 4 of their ITD. We needed a little bit more work to have a working version on python 3.6, with pip and all needed dependencies, on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial machine, so we think the Prerequisite section may have been expanded more. \\
In particular, to install a working version of Django we had to invoke the following console commands: \\

\begin{commandshell}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade python3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
cd path/to/Implementation
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
\end{commandshell}
~\\
After that, we had problems in running the Django server from the I\&T/Implementation folder, while everything worked perfectly in the folder extracted from the implementation2017\_01\_07.rar archive. \\

We also installed the project on a Windows 10 machine using the python3 installer found \href{https://www.python.it/download/}{here}, and then typing 
\begin{commandshell}
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
\end{commandshell}
