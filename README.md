# Travlendar+

The	objective	of this	project, named Travlendar+,	is to apply in practice what we have learnt during Software Engineering 2 lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way.

The project is subdivided into 4 main parts:
* The Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD), with the purpose of completely analyzing and describing in a formal and non-ambiguous way the system in terms of its intended domain of use, of the goals it should aim at and of the requirements it should enforce.
* The Design Document (DD), with the purpose of describing the architecture of the system for the project, giving both its high level description and a more detailed representation of the various artifacts that will compose it.
* The Implementation and Test Document (ITD), with the main purpose of describing the structure of the code of the Travlendar+ first implementation, together with the main development choices such as the programming language adopted and the frameworks used.
* The Acceptance Test Document (ATD), with the main purpose of controlling and testing the project of another group of students for a peer review phase.

All of the final releases of the documents can be found in the [Releases](/Releases) folder.

The project includes also the implementation of a prototype, whose code can be found in the [Travlendar](/Travlendar) folder or in the [implementation](https://github.com/TommasoBianchi/BettiBianchi_SWENG2/tree/implementation) branch. More info on how to install and run it can be found there or in the Implementation and Test Document.
