Testing is a crucial part of the developing process of a system and Ruby on Rails knows it perfectly. It dedicates a whole independent folder of the system to facilitate their implementation. \\
In our particular case, since we make the choice of providing small prototypes, tests become precious; after that a test, that certify that a specific functionality of the project works, has been created, every subsequent modifications will have to deal with it to check if this change has introduced a bug in the system or not. \\
We decided to build two types of test called Model Test and System Test.

\subsection{Model Test}
model test blabla

\subsection{System Test}
system test blablablac
