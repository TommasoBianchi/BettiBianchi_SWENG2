If you have installed Ruby through the installer you should already have also Rails, otherwise just open a console and type \verb;gem install rails; (NOTE: this may require to manually solve some dependencies if you havent't used rvm).
It is also require to have nodejs in the environment for the Rails Assets Pipeline, and you can install it typing the following in a console (linux): \\
\verb;curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -; \\
\verb;sudo apt-get install -y nodejs;
