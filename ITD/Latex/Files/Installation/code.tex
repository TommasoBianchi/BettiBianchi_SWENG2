Clone the source code from \href{https://github.com/TommasoBianchi/BettiBianchi_SWENG2}{here} if you haven't already, then navigate to the Travlendar folder. Open a console and type 
\begin{commandshell}bundle install\end{commandshell}
to download all the dependencies, then 
\begin{commandshell}rake db:setup\end{commandshell} to build the database and finally 
\begin{commandshell}rails server\end{commandshell}
