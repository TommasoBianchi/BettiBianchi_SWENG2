Clone the source code from \href{https://github.com/TommasoBianchi/BettiBianchi_SWENG2}{here} if you haven't already, then navigate to the Travlendar folder. Open a console and type \verb;bundle install; to download all the dependencies, then \verb;rake db:setup; to build the database and finally \verb;rails server; to run the rails server on localhost. \\
In case you have problems installing the pg gem, try running \verb;bundle config build.pg --with-pg-config=[path_to_postgres_installation]/bin/pg_config;.
You should now be able to access the application on \href{http://localhost:3000/}{http://localhost:3000/}.
